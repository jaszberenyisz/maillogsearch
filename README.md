mail.log search is a free web based tool to make linux based mail servers administration easier.<br />
You can configure a few simple parameters and make simple searches in the log files.<br />
Contains some formatting for easy overview (with text coloration) and clickable e-mail addresses and e-mail IDs.<br />
<br />
The program only reads the files, but be aware! Do not expose it to the public internet!<br />
The program comes with absolutely no warranty!<br />
